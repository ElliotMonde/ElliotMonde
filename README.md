 ## Hi, I’m Elliot Phua  
 ✨  🛠️ I’m interested in creating stuff, making art & music, and tackling challenges  
   
 ✨  ⚡ I’m currently learning Algo and DS, using Python and C, computational structures and tinkering with Arduinos and ESPs!  
   
 ✨  🐾 I’m keen to collaborate on small, fun projects
    
 ✨  🎨 I’m [currently collaborating on an `interactive website`](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elliotphua/details/projects/) that will document Victoria Junior College's memories and history before its current campus is demolished.       
   
 ✨ 👨🏻‍💻 Open to intern end `Aug - Dec 2024` for roles in `Software Engineering Intern, Product Development, Product Manager, or Embedded Systems Engineer` in Singapore or remotely
